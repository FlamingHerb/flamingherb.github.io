        <p class="ps2">"You're not joking with me, are you?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">"I'm not, Commander. That's how bizarre it is."</p>
        <p class="ps2">Bizarre would be the different word Langley would use in this case; it would borderline impossible at what she was reading through her hastened flipping of pages in the manifold. The creaking sounds of the elevator stopped short, opening as the scent of blood, sweat, and tears poured over from the halls.</p>
        <p class="ps2">The two agents stepped out of it, greeted by others in either a quick salute or a nod. The agent beside the Commander, a well-dressed man with his face covered by his hat's shadow, frantically kept up with Langley's quickened pace. Each tap of her cane only flinched the rest, as it got faster and faster as they approached the end of the hall.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"You've tested everything? Did you send at least a flesh at the Ring Institute? Summer?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">She hissed out of her tongue as the agent scratched his cheek.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"They'd called us insane if we do. Even then, would we risk showing this to anyone?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">Langley sighed as she placed her hand on the handle of the door frame.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"Better than sitting ducks, Omega."</p>
        <p class="ps2">The two agents were greeted by blinding lights pointed at the center of the room, blanketing the rest of the room in darkness. The reeking smell of dead flesh forced Omega to cover his mouth as he gagged. Langley hoisted her head up in intrigue, the rest giving way for her as she stood still beside the table.</p>
        <p class="ps2">The dead monster fouled the room with its stench, disfigured with its bones jutting out. Its scars were shut and sealed by fresh stitches, needles stained with blood still at the tool stand beside the table. Its eyes were completely left hollow, staring far into the darkness around them.</p>
        <p class="ps2">Langley narrowed her eyes. A pig as long as a human, as stout as it, with human feet to bear. Scraps of cloth acted as it draped, wrapped around its dead carcass like a mummy's did. Her expression did not change still.</p>
        <p class="ps2">With a snap of a finger, Omega coughed and lowered his hand, coughing as he raised his hand to the thing.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"This is it, Commander. The anomaly we found at Old London."</p>
        <p class="ps2">Langley tapped the thing with her cane, the texture of thick skin pushing it back.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"You didn't bring us a Mania bomb, did you?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">He shook his head as the rest stood back.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"No. As I said, there are no traces of Mania. No traces of corruption. Nor being a Corruptor." He frowned. "This is an honest-to-God monster we're looking at, Commander."</p>
        <p class="ps2">Langley bit her lip, tapping her cane back to the ground. The rest flinched.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"Origins? Creator? Anything?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">"None. The Sties just found it in their routine search for Mania weapons trade." <span class="Scrivener-converted-space"> </span>He scratched his head. "At first, they thought their equipment was broken, but nothing sounded off after that. What was shocking, however, was that these things are intelligent."</p>
        <p class="ps2">"How much?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">Omega breathed in.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"The Sties called them manpigs."</p>
        <p class="ps2">The Commander's hand clenched, sighing. "Have they done anything significant?"</p>
        <p class="ps2">"None. We have no clue. Not even a trace of Parma." Omega shook his head. </p>
        <p class="ps2">A turn of her head made Omega gulp. </p>
        <p class="ps2">"Tell the Sties Division they have a new mission." She turned her head towards the personnel. "Examine the body more. We already have trouble as is from the Drifter Camp. Give me the report by the end of the week."</p>
        <p class="ps2">They saluted as Langley placed her hand to her heart. In an instant, the two agents left the room as the door closed to a screeching halt. The rest of the agents around the hallway sprayed the area with fragrance as more agents went to the room in silence. The same song and dance as they entered the elevator once more.</p>
        <p class="ps2">Langley gave the clipboard back to Omega as she placed both hands on her cane, tapping it on the metal floor of the ascending elevator.</p>
        <p class="ps2">"Access only for top-level personnel. Never let Paradeisos know of this. Not even Parma." Omega nodded. "Inform Alpha. We have much work to do."</p>
        <p class="ps2">The two stood silent as the racketing noise of the elevator prevailed; the shadows shrouded their being once more.</p>
